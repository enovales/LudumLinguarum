Ludum Linguarum
===============

Ludum Linguarum is a set of tools and recipes to extract localized content (currently just text) from a set of known 
games. This text can then be turned into flash cards for use with [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) (one of the most popular 
[spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) software programs, with clients for all major
desktop and mobile platforms).
