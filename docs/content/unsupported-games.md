Unsupportable Games
===================
The following is a list of games that I have examined, and determined to be 
unsupportable with this project, along with the reason why.

* Crazy Taxi (bitmap images are used for localization, rather than text)
* Sega Bass Fishing (bitmap images are used for localization, rather than text)


Games Unlikely to be Supported
==============================
The following is a list of games that are unlikely to be supported,
due to the difficulty of reverse-engineering their file formats, or high
time investment required to do so.

* BattleBlock Theater
* Castle Crashers
* FlatOut
* PAC-MAN Championship Edition DX+
